# Bogota Design Language

Bogota is the design language used for the Nobili software, which includes apps, the OS, etc.
Bogota takes a modern approach to design.

## Platforms

- :material-cellphone-text: __[Design apps for Nobili](nobili_apps)__ - the home of Bogota
- :material-web-plus: __Use Bogota [on the web](nobili_css)__ and simplify your web UI
- :material-android: __Don't leave out Android!__ Use the [Bogota stylesheet](android_bogota_style) or [Flutter](bogota_flutter)
- :material-apple: __iOS?__ The only way to get Bogota on that is Flutter
